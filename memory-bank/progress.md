## MVP Architecture Changes

We've made the following architecture changes to simplify the MVP:

1. **Single Household Approach**: Implemented a system where all users share one household. The first user to register becomes the owner, and all subsequent users become members of that household.
2. **Simplified User Onboarding**: All new users automatically join the existing household, eliminating the need for household selection or switching in the MVP.
3. **Created `fn_ensure_user_in_household` function**: This new database function handles the logic of ensuring a user is part of the household, either by joining an existing one or creating a new one if none exists.

- Tandrify's Account: Initial balance $1,000

### Test Transactions
