## MVP Architecture Changes

We've made the following architecture changes to simplify the MVP:

1. **Household Approach**: Implemented a system where users can either join an existing household as a member or become the owner of a newly created household during registration.
2. **Simplified User Onboarding**: During registration, users can choose to either join an existing household or create their own, providing flexibility while maintaining simplicity in the MVP.
3. **Created `fn_ensure_user_in_household` function**: This new database function handles the logic of ensuring a user is part of a household by either joining an existing one or creating a new one if they choose to do so.
